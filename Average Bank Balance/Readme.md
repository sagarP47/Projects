# Overview
This is a simple application of OpenCV and pytesseract to extract text from a bank statement and then calculate Average Bank Balance using extrarcted text

# Motivation
I am working as a data scientist in financial domain for past few years.
My previous organization used to pay some third party vendor which used to give us the Average Bank Balance and other required information about a customer from its bank statement.
so thats when I thought of working on this project and have used my own bank statement to write the code.
I have written an extensive Medium article on this same as below:
